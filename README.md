## Usage & Installation

You can install and fork off of this repository, however, these are the following steps that need to be entered in your terminal to download this React application: `npm run build`, `npm install react-router-dom` (for the routes) and lastly `npm start`.

This portfolio was made through React components to make one dynamic webpage. Each page consists of a footer, header and navigation menu which stays the same throughout all pages. The "About Me" page contains information about me, the Portfolio link consists of applications that have been created, their deployed links once you click on their image and the GitHub links. Lastly, the "Contact Me" has a form a user can use to contact me and if they need more information, they can download my resume from the Resume tab.
