            <p>My name is Sabrina and I live in Toronto, Canada. I am a well-rounded individual who enjoys fitness,
                meditation,video games and music festivals. I have a background in administrative work in the legal
                and HR world, however, I wanted a more meaningful impact in what I do, so now when I am not in front
                of a barbell or spending time with my dog, I am working towards helping individuals and companies
                make websites and applications for their services and products. </p>
